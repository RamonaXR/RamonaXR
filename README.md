# Hi, I'm Ramona!

I'm a passionate developer with a background in frontend development, having recently completed a higher academic degree in the field. I love crafting engaging, responsive, and accessible user interfaces, and I'm committed to continuous growth and learning.

## What I'm Up To Now
I'm excited to announce that I'm expanding my skill set into backend development. My goal is to create robust, secure, and efficient solutions that power dynamic web applications. While I focus on learning backend technologies, I'll continue to keep my frontend skills sharp.

## Future Projects & Experimentation
I plan to dedicate a lot of time to personal projects that allow me to grow and experiment with new tech stacks. This hands-on approach will help me explore innovative solutions and expand my expertise across both frontend and backend domains.
